# rfboot

**Notice: The bootloader is in a quite workable state. However the site is incomplete and a lot of modifications need to be done.
I hope in a few days (say until 31 March 2017) the code, PCB files etc will be added and this notice will be removed**

Bootloader for Atmega328 over the air (OTA) using the TI CC1101 chip

A lot of electronic projects need to communicate with other components via an RF module. This project aims at speeding up and simplifying workflow, by allowing the program to be uploaded via the RF link. The emphasis is on reliability and security

- [Rfboot in Action](https://github.com/pkarsy/rfboot/wiki/Reliabi) A good starting point. And gives us an idea of what tools we need to have in order to work with rfboot.

- [Installation](https://github.com/pkarsy/rfboot/wiki/Installation) A bootloader, and especially a wireless one, is a relatively complex topic. In this section instructions are given to make the process as straithforward as possible.

- [Reliability](https://github.com/pkarsy/rfboot/wiki/Reliability) Explains how rfboot does the job under an inherently unreliable link(RF)
