2017-09-10 rftool: Now rftool accept "terminal" as synonymous to "monitor"

2017-09-10 rftool: The special reset string "MANUAL" can be used inside app_settings.h
to instruct rftool to not warn us about missing reset string. Useful if we use
an external tool to reset the remote target.

2017-09-09 rftool: Major code cleanup

2017-09-09 rftool: Now upload supports .elf and .hex files, not only binary files.
This in practice means that there is no need to convert the ELF file
in binary format in the Makefile.

2017-09-09 CHANGELOG file created. Maybe too late, as almost all functionality is
there.
