### rftool

This is the tool to be used instead of avrdude when uploading code.<br/>
It has also the duty to create new projects.<br/>
It is writen in the excellent nim programming language <br/>https://nim-lang.org/<br/>
To compile the code type "make help" or just "make" to see the available options.<br/>
A precompiled, statically linked x86_64 binary is provided, if you do not want to compile the code.
