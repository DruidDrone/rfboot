This is the arduino library for the CC1101 chip.

It is based on panstamp library and has the same licence of course : LGPLv3 or later
It has many simplifications compared to the original panStamp library.

Must be installed in the arduino library folder

Note:
This library, converted to pure C, is also used by the bootloader. See the /rfboot/cc1101
folder
