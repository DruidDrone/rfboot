Rfboot is Licensed under **GPLv3**.

The following notes are not modifications to the rfboot license, but a summary of what I understand,
with the hope that someone with more knowledge will help me correct any misunderstandings.

- If you do any modifications to the code and you want to distribute them, you have
to use the same license.

- if you want to use rfboot in a commercial product, giving the customers
the opportunity to upload code wirelesly, it is perfectly OK, but if you modified
the bootloader, you need to give back under GPLv3 the modifications / improvements.
This is the Right thing to do anyway.
Probably this is a duplicate of the above.

- If you want to use rfboot to upload a proprietary/closed source application,
it should be OK, and i fact I will be happy if rfboot helps you in your job.
This is because the application (no matter if it is AVR assembler or Arduino sketch) and the bootloader
use different source code trees.

It should be obvious but to be really sure: channel, syncword, XTEA key are just numbers.
They are not modifications to the code, and you don't publish them.

Generally, I will be glad if you want to offer corrections or improvements to the code/documentation.
