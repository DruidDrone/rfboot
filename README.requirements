A lot in fact

- atmega328p only. Should be easy to port to similar AVR MCUs
- CC1101 chip. There are a lot of sub GHz RF chips out there, but I am not familiar with any of them
- Only linux (for development)  at the moment . this alone is ruling out a lot of potential users I am afraid
- In order to communicate with and upload code to MCU, the usb2rf module must be attached to the PC
- The rftool software must be installeed somewere to the PC
