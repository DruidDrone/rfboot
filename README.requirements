A lot in fact

- atmega328p only. Should be easy to port to similar AVR MCUs. You need an ISP programmer like usbtiny or usbasp to burn
the bootloader (rfboot) in the MCU
- CC1101 rf module. 
- Only linux support at the moment as this is the platform I use.
- In order to communicate with and upload code to MCU, the usb2rf module must be attached to the PC. See README in the usb2rf folder
- The rftool software must be installeed somewere to the PC
